Reached Day 10! A major focus for me in growing my dev skils is management. I want to develop a personal system that will facilitate "Development Effeciency".
The blog, changelogs, Trello board are all attempts at adding resources to this system. 

Day 10 seems like a good time to assess and plan for the next couple sessions.

I'd like to continue on with the tutorial.

Seems like a good time to flush out the design documents.
