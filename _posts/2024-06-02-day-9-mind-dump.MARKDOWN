I've reached a minor setback. I am at the stage in the tutorial where the player will select the intel that they want to use to create a mission brief and combine it to create the brief.
I went on a side branch to create a series of "rarity borders" for the intel items in the game. Now I need to know when to apply them. I thought that I was going to use
them as placeholders for where the intel items would be dragged to when you were creating you brief but that doesn't make sense because the intel would already have a rarity border after it 
ws analyzed.

I think I will store the rarity borders on the intel items themselves and then have reveal after the intel item is analyzed. Then, when the player selects to send the item to _houston
houston will display the rarity border with the color of the most rare intel item on the staging list.
