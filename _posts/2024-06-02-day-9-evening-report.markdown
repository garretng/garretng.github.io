Current Design Overview:

The player character, a spy, has been burned from their organization and is now on the run. Therefore, at the beginning of the game, everything the player does is on their tablet.

Implemented Features:

Next Steps:

We are working towards enabling the player to start a mission. To start a mission, 
the player needs to send Intel to the mission brief app to procedurally generate a mission
based on the Intel given. For the tutorial, the mission will not be
procedurally generated and will instead be an example mission.

Let's get started!!
