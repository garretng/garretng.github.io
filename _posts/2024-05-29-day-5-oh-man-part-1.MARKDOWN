I just lost about over 5 under 11 hours of work. Was going too fast and accidently deleted a prefab. I sat there for a second and decided I'd take some time to rethink my approach.

As of now there is a tablet on the right hand side of the screen where the player will move through different programs to interact with the game.
I think I should make a prefab for each program that I'm going to write on the tablet.
