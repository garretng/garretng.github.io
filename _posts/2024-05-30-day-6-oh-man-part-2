_...As of now there is a tablet on the right hand side of the screen where the player will move through different programs to interact with the game.
I think I should make a prefab for each program that I'm going to write on the tablet..._

After losing 10 hours of work last night I re-focused and put in some work into the system controlling the tablets display. Specifically, worked on two tablet applications.
