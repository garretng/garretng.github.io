#SPY RUN
decided on a name: Spy Run. Came with it while talking about it with a friend of mine

#Progress Report
Worked on the GUI all morning. Decided to add a desk a with a laptop and 2 phones on it in the foreground of the main scene. These devices will act as a 
HUB for interacting with the game. Here the player will see their stats and have the ability to interact with the various controls, menus, agent rosters, mission controls, hideout upgrades, and monitor intelligence. 
Just a few things.
