I didn't post on day 11 because I was grinding away on the game. But I think day 11 will go down as the day that Spy Run heard its heartbeat for the first time. Day 11 was the day
that I landed on a combat system for Spy Run and I think it has potential to be really fun. What I like most is how approachable the basic idea is but how layered and deep I can go
within its constraints. This is exciting creatively because the idea is so fundamentally sound, adding layers to this base system won't impact it. In fact the system invites new layers.

This is a breakthrough, not only for Spy Run, but for the creative part of myself. I can't remember a time when I was this excited about a creative idea. And for the first time I have
the technical skill to pull it off. Good feeling.

The plan is to now complete the demo of the combat with in the next 19 Days.

Let's get to work.
